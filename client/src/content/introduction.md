# Welcome to LLM Builder

## How to Use This Repository
Welcome to an interactive journey where you will build a Large Language Model (LLM) from scratch!

This environment is designed to be **hands-on**. You won't just read code; you will run it, visualize it, and modify it.

### The Layout
*   **📚 The Guide (Left Panel)**: This is where you are reading right now. It contains the conceptual explanations and step-by-step instructions.
*   **💻 Code Editor (Top Right)**: A full Python environment running right in your browser (powered by Pyodide). You can write and execute code here.
*   **🖥️ Output Console (Top Right Tab)**: Click the "Output" tab to see the results of your Python scripts (print statements, errors, etc.).
*   **🎨 Visualization Panel (Bottom Right)**: This is the magic window. It will dynamically change as you progress through the chapters, showing you:
    *   Architecture Diagrams
    *   Tokenization in real-time
    *   Attention Heatmaps
    *   Live Training Graphs
    *   Chat Interfaces

### Getting Started
Click the **"Next"** button below (or the arrow in the top right) to begin with **Chapter 1: Understanding LLMs**.

*Happy Building!*
